The foreign exchange (Forex) market exhibits frequent price movements that can be modeled to support systematic trading. This project builds a simple forecasting pipeline using the EUR/USD currency pair and a simple arbitrage–signal detector using machine learning. Historical rates (FRED, 2014–2024) are preprocessed into features including a 30‑day moving average, rolling volatility, lagged values, and rate of change. Three base regressors—Linear Regression, k‑Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and XGBoost—are trained and evaluated, alongside a Decision Tree Regressor. Their outputs are combined with a `VotingRegressor` ensemble to improve stability and accuracy over any single model.

The trained ensemble is used in an autoregressive loop to generate short‑horizon daily forecasts, which are then scanned by a rule‑based detector for local minima/maxima that exceed a configurable threshold, yielding “buy/sell” opportunity flags. Model performance is reported with MAE, MSE, and R² on held‑out data; qualitative plots compare predicted vs. actual series. This work focuses on end‑of‑day/daily forecasting rather than high‑frequency execution. Future extensions include richer technical features (e.g., RSI, MACD), additional model families (e.g., SVM), probabilistic uncertainty estimates, and evaluation on multi‑pair datasets and live paper trading.
